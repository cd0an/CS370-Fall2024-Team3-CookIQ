Backlog:

1. As a new user, I want to see a list of questions that allows me to use the drop-down menu to select my dietary restrictions, health goals, cuisines, cooking preferences, and budget, and use a text box to input my available ingredients, so that I only get meal suggestions that fit my needs. 
2. As a new user, I want to see meal recommendations ranked by best match and be able to like/dislike them, including saving my liked recipes, so that future suggestions improve over time. 
3. As a new user, I want to see a sidebar menu that allows me to click on an option to create a new account and log in so that my meal preferences and like/dislike history are linked to an account for future use.
